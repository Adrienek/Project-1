# Project-1
Used Pandas to clean and format my datasets. 
Created a Jupyter notebook describing the data exploration and cleanup process.
Created a Jupyter notebook illustrating the final data analysis.
Used Matplotlib to create 6 to 8 visualizations of my data 
Saved PNG images of my visualizations to distribute to the class and instructional team—and for 
inclusion in your presentation.
Created a write-up summarizing your major findings. This should included a heading for each “question” 
that I asked your data as well as a short description of my findings and any relevant plots.
Used an API with data pertinent to your primary research questions
